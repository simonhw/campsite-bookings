## User Experience
### Initial Discussion
The [NAME] Campsite is a website that facilitates bookings for small and large groups for one night or more of camping. The goal of the site is to encourage business by showcasing the campsite information and offering a user-friendly booking system to users. The website will show reviews left by former customers which can be managed by the website administrators.

### User Stories
The user stories for this project can be viewed on this [Kanban board]() on the GitHub repository.

## Design
### Colour Scheme
A palette of green colours was chosen to reflect the calming and relaxing environment of the campsite, being surround by greenery and nature away from the hustle and bustle of the cities.

### Typography
The Sedan font was chosen from the Google Fonts library because it evoked feelings of a professional but fun business.
